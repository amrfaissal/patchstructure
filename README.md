# patchstructure [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mitchellh/patchstructure?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mitchellh/patchstructure)

patchstructure is a Go library for applying patches to modify existing
Go structures.

patchstructure is based on
[JSON Patch (RFC 6902)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902), but
applies to Go strucutures instead of JSON objects.

The goal of patchstructure is to provide a single API and format for
representing and applying changes to Go structures. With this in place,
diffs between structures can be represented, changes to a structure
can be treated as a log, etc.
